    Theres a lot of contrast in the song. the free bird experiencing joy and free space, he has a lot of self esteem and confindence. Nothing steps on his way and he feels free to do and think how ever he likes.<br>
    On the oppisite side, the caged bird experiencing extreme boundry and inability to have the things that the free bird is already used to. All he can do is sing for a better future for himself.<br>
    The dream of the poet is for every bird (meaning every human) to have the possibility for a limitless future, to stop caging birds and stopping them fro expressing themselves and contribute to nature (the world/humanity)
